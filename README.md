# IndividualProjectPythonTasks
This is a repository for implementing tasks in the Python language.

### Install ###

To run the program code from a file, you need to start working with Python3 and get access to the Python interpreter. Python is available on the Python Software Foundation https://www.python.org website. Alternatively, there are a number of sites that allow you to access the Python interpreter online, without having to install anything on your computer.
